Although fundamental aspects of such a balance of\\nmutation and selection pressure have been established by the qua-\\nsispecies theory decades ago, its implications have largely re-\\nmained qualitative. Here, we present a quantitative approach to\\nmodel the virus evolution under cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune\\nresponse. The virus quasispecies dynamics are explicitly repre-\\nsented by mutations in the combined sequence space of a set of\\nepitopes within the viral genome. We stochastically simulated the\\ngrowth of a viral population originating from a single wild-type\\nfounder virus and its recognition and clearance by the immune re-\\nsponse, as well as the expansion of its genetic diversity. Applied to\\nthe immune escape of a simian immunodeficiency virus epitope,\\nmodel predictions were quantitatively comparable to the experi-\\nmental data. Within the model parameter space, we found two\\nqualitatively different regimes of infectious disease pathogenesis,\\neach representing alternative fates of the immune response: It can\\nclear the infection in finite time or eventually be overwhelmed by\\nviral growth and escape mutation. The latter regime exhibits the\\ncharacteristic disease progression pattern of human immunodefi-\\nciency virus, while the former is bounded by maximum mutation\\nrates that can be suppressed by the immune response. Our results\\ndemonstrate that, by explicitly representing epitope mutations\\nand thus providing a genotype–phenotype map, the quasispecies\\ntheory can form the basis of a detailed sequence-specific model of\\nreal-world viral pathogens evolving under immune selection.\\n\\npopulation dynamics ∣ next-generation sequencing ∣ stochastic simulation ∣\\nHIV\\n\\nViruses with RNA genomes, such as human immunodeficiencyvirus type 1 (HIV-1), have high rates of mutation and evolve\\nrapidly in response to host immune selection pressure. One of the\\nconsequences of such rapid mutations is the error catastrophe\\n(1), where a virus population is driven to extinction when its mu-\\ntation rate exceeds a threshold. The existence of such a threshold\\nis a central prediction of the quasispecies theory pioneered by\\nEigen (1) and Swetina and Schuster (2). The recent experimental\\ndemonstration of lethal mutagenesis (3–5), in which an error cat-\\nastrophe transition is caused by mutagens, demonstrates that key\\nfeatures of the balance of mutation and selection in viruses are\\nelegantly captured by the quasispecies theory.\\n\\nAlthough insights provided by the quasispecies theory have\\ngreatly expanded our understanding of virus behavior, applica-\\ntions so far have been limited to a conceptual level, partially due\\nto the lack of experimental information on the evolutionary dy-\\nnamics in sequence space. Next-generation sequencing techni-\\nques (6) have the potential to change this situation. To build\\nquantitative models implementing the quasispecies dynamics\\nand describe such experimental data, it is important to realisti-\\ncally specify the nature of selection pressure. Viruses in animal\\nhosts evolve under immune pressure, and their capacity for rapid\\nescape mutation underlies many of the difficulties in combating\\npathogens, including HIV-1. In a typical disease pathogenesis of\\nHIV-1, the acute viremia after an initial infection is curbed by\\n\\nCD8þ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses as well as subse-\\nquent antibody actions, leading to an asymptomatic chronic infec-\\ntion stage that can last up to 10 y (7). However, this apparent\\ncontrol of viremia is never complete, and without antiviral ther-\\napy, the chronic infection eventually leads to the onset of disease.\\nThis chronic infection stage involves continuous escape mutation-\\nCTL response cycles, whose detailed characteristics are being un-\\ncovered by ultradeep sequencing (8–12). CTLs recognize specific\\nviral epitopes (approximately 10 amino acids long) presented on\\nthe surface of infected cells by class I human leukocyte antigen\\n(HLA). The epitope recognition depends sensitively on HLA al-\\nleles, leading to differential patterns of immune response among\\npatients (13–15), while characteristics of immune response during\\nearly infection often shape and influence the overall disease pro-\\ngression (16, 17). Quantitative sequence-based models of virus-\\nCTL dynamics will greatly facilitate the interpretation of experi-\\nmental data.\\n\\nIn a series of pioneering works (18–20), Nowak and coworkers\\nintroduced population dynamics concepts that capture a diverse\\nrange of immune response and escape mutation. Similar ap-\\nproaches focused more on escape dynamics have also been pro-\\nposed (21, 22). These models, however, do not describe mutations\\nin sequence space explicitly. Other mathematical models of\\nsequence evolution focus on sequence divergence during the very\\nearly stages of infection, while ignoring or only implicitly including\\nthe effect of selection pressure (23, 24). In this paper, we describe\\na quantitative quasispecies-based model of virus dynamics under\\nT cell-based immune pressure, explicitly mapping genotype–phe-\\nnotype relationships. Our approach combines the description of\\nvirus evolutionary dynamics provided by the quasispecies theory\\nand the population dynamics models of Nowak and coworkers.\\nWe show that the model not only captures the salient features\\nobserved in sequencing data of simian immunodeficiency virus\\n(SIV) (9) but also reveals general qualitative features of viral\\ninfection disease pathogenesis: The immune system can clear\\nthe infection within time scales ranging from days to those much\\nlonger than patient lifetimes, or be overwhelmed by immune es-\\ncape. The viral load progression in the latter regime closely\\nmatches the observed HIV-1 disease pathogenesis pattern.\\n\\nResults and Discussion\\nStochastic Quasispecies Dynamics.During acute infection, the foun-\\nder virus (often a single virion) (7, 11, 17, 25) undergoes replica-\\ntions to produce an exponentially growing population, which may\\nbe described by the quasispecies dynamics without degradation,\\n\\nAuthor contributions: H.-J.W. designed research; H.-J.W. performed research; H.-J.W. and\\nJ.R. analyzed data; and H.-J.W. and J.R. wrote the paper.\\n\\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\\n\\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\\n\\nFreely available online through the PNAS open access option.\\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

A more\\ncomplete description for early stages of infection, where ni is of\\nthe order of 1 and restricted to integer values, is given by the che-\\nmical reaction representation\\n\\nRi →\\nQjiri\\n\\nRi þRj; [2]\\n\\nwhere Ri is a virion with genotype i. Eq. 2 can be simulated\\nstochastically with the Gillespie algorithm (26). A major advan-\\ntage of such a stochastic formulation is that it allows us to avoid\\nexhaustive enumerations of all possible genotypes. This is signif-\\nicant even for a single epitope of viral proteins: An amino acid\\nsequence with La ¼ 10, whose genome length is L ¼ 3La ¼\\n30 bp, still has 4L ∼ 1018 genotypes. Nowak and Schuster (27)\\nperformed Gillespie algorithm simulations of the standard qua-\\nsispecies model under the single-peak fitness landscape (ri ¼ 1∕τ\\nfor the wild-type (WT) sequence and ri ¼ 1∕Aτ for all other mu-\\ntants, whereA > 1 is the relative fitness of theWTand τ is a char-\\nacteristic time scale). In this case, distributions of individuals\\namong only two groups (WT and mutants) need to be tracked.\\n\\nIn our numerical simulations, the initial genotype (referred to\\nhere as the WT) replicates with mutation rate μ, and the gener-\\nated mutants are compared with the existing list of sequences,\\nwhich is updated dynamically when new sequences arise. We ver-\\nified that this numerical scheme sampled the relevant sequence\\nspace sufficiently (SI Text, Figs. S1–S3). The initial condition we\\nused (single WT) and the discreteness of ni imply that ni should\\nbe interpreted as the total number of virions within a finite sys-\\ntem. The HIV-1 viral load during the acute infection phase can\\nreach up to 104 ∼ 106 RNA copies/mL (7). Accounting for the\\nvolume of blood in the body of an average adult (approximately\\n5 L), the total population size Nv ¼ Σi ni would be up to about\\n109. We found simulations to slow down significantly as Nv be-\\ncame larger than about 106. For computational efficiency, we\\ntherefore regarded the system as a small representative volume\\n(1 mL) of blood, and the viral loads and CTL levels reported refer\\nto RNA copy numbers and cell counts within this volume.\\n\\nCTL Response. Within an infected host, the action of the cellular\\nimmune response provides the major force countering the acute\\nviremia. In this work, we combine the population dynamics ap-\\nproach of virus-immune system dynamics by Nowak and cowor-\\nkers (18, 19) with the classic quasispecies theory. Accordingly,\\nEq. 2 is modified as follows:\\n\\nRi →\\nQjiri\\n\\nRi þRj; ðreplication with mutationÞ [3A]\\n\\nRi→\\nb\\nRi þ∑\\n\\nl\\n\\nk¼1\\nCðαikÞ; ðstimulationÞ [3B]\\n\\nRi þ CðαikÞ→\\np\\nCðαikÞ; ðclearanceÞ [3C]\\n\\nCðαÞ→\\ng\\n0; ðdecayÞ [3D]\\n\\nwhere the genotype i is now a member of the combined sequence\\nspace of l epitopes. The amino acid sequence (“phenotype”) of\\nepitope k in genotype i is denoted as αik, and CðαÞ represents a\\n\\nCTL specific to phenotype α. Eq. 3B represents a reaction in\\nwhich, with a rate b, virions of sequence i stimulate the produc-\\ntion of a set of CTLs CðαikÞ corresponding to the phenotypes of\\nits epitopes. Eq. 3C denotes the reaction where cells infected with\\nviruses with genotype i are cleared by CTLs with phenotypes that\\nmatch one of its epitopes with a rate p, and Eq. 3D represents the\\nnatural decay of T cells with a rate g. Under the alternative de-\\nterministic continuum approximation, one may write:\\n\\n_nj ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nQjirini − p∑\\nl\\n\\nk¼1\\ncðαjkÞnj; [4A]\\n\\n_cðαÞ ¼ bnα − gcðαÞ; [4B]\\n\\nwhere cðαÞ is the number of Tcells CðαÞ and nα is the total num-\\nber of virions containing epitopes with phenotype α.\\n\\nThe qualitative features of the infection-clearance dynamics\\ncan be illustrated by setting the mutation rate μ to zero. Numer-\\nical integrations of Eq. 4 yield the continuum approximation re-\\nsult (Fig. S4 for μ ¼ 0 and l ¼ 1), which showed reasonable\\nagreement with the stochastic simulation results. For nonvanish-\\ning mutation rates, numerical integration rapidly becomes prohi-\\nbitive with increasing L because of the high dimensionality of the\\nsequence space. The inverse of b is a measure of the time delay of\\nthe growth of T cells compared to that of viruses. Here, we\\nadopted b values of approximately 0.01 d−1. The efficiency of\\nCTLs in recognizing cells presenting the epitope and killing them\\nis represented by parameter p, the clearance rate. We found\\np values of 10−4 ∼ 10−3 d−1 to give good fits to experiments\\n(see below).\\n\\nImmune Escape Dynamics. To make comparisons with experiments,\\nit is necessary to consider that fitness is determined by amino acid\\nsequences, and many mutations are synonymous. Therefore, the\\nfull immune escape dynamics represented by Eq. 3 distinguishes\\nthe amino acid sequence αik corresponding to the nucleotide\\nsequence of epitope k in genotype i. We refer to the set of nu-\\ncleotide and amino acid sequences as “genotypes” and “pheno-\\ntypes,” respectively. The fitness ri is a function of phenotypes\\nonly. During simulations, each genotype is translated into a phe-\\nnotype, and a new mutant is checked against the existing pheno-\\ntype/genotype list, which is updated and expanded. The nature of\\nthis genotype–phenotype map plays important roles in evolution-\\nary dynamics, leading to key signatures of selective pressure, such\\nas the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous mutations (28).\\nQuantitative insights to the effects of this mapping on molecular\\nevolution have been provided by Manrubia and coworkers (29),\\nwho studied short RNA sequences for which fitness can be esti-\\nmated by secondary structure predictions. In our case, a simpli-\\nfied overview of the genotype–phenotype map can be gleaned\\nfrom a network representation of the genetic code (Fig. S5): If\\nall mutations were neutral and amino acids within an epitope in-\\ndependent, this map would be sufficient to determine the statis-\\ntics of evolutionary drifts. The accessibility of certain mutations\\nfrom a phenotype, in particular, has been shown to affect the\\nevolvability of viruses (30).\\n\\nAnother major ingredient for a realistic model of immune es-\\ncape is the fitness landscape beyond the level of the single-peak\\nmodel. Much progress has been made recently in understanding\\nthe nature of fitness landscapes (31–34). Explicit fitness measure-\\nments of viral clones (35, 36) and biochemical assays of proteins\\n(37) both indicate that single-nucleotide substitutions lead to a\\nbroad distribution of fitness changes, most of which are deleter-\\nious. Therefore, one may assume that the fitness of a mutant is a\\nrandom variable centered around a mean fitness value f . We ex-\\npect this mean fitness to be a decreasing function of distance d to\\nthe WT (the number of amino acids that are different), which we\\n\\nWoo and Reifman PNAS ∣ August 7, 2012 ∣ vol. 109 ∣ no. 32 ∣ 12981\\n\\nBI\\nO\\nPH\\n\\nYS\\nIC\\nS\\nA\\nN\\nD\\n\\nCO\\nM\\nPU\\n\\nTA\\nTI\\nO\\nN\\nA\\nL\\nBI\\nO\\nLO\\n\\nG\\nY\\n\\nD\\now\\n\\nnl\\noa\\n\\nde\\nd \\n\\nby\\n g\\n\\nue\\nst\\n\\n o\\nn \\n\\nA\\npr\\n\\nil \\n23\\n\\n, 2\\n02\\n\\n0 \\n\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=STXT\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF1\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF3\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF4\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF4\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF5\\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1117201109/-/DCSupplemental/pnas.1117201109_SI.pdf?targetid=SF5\\n\\n\\nassume to be exponential: f ðdÞ ¼ expð−d∕ξÞ, where ξ denotes a\\ncharacteristic distance (Methods).\\n\\nAn empirical evidence for this choice can be found from a re-\\ncent experimental study by Fernández et al. (37), who measured\\nthe fitness landscapes of HIV-1 protease quasispecies for three\\npatients. We plotted the distribution of their reported fitness\\nvalues as a function of distance to the dominant phenotype\\nand found near-exponential dependence for two quasispecies\\n(Fig. S6). Our fitness function therefore models both the de-\\ncrease of the mean fitness away from WT and the distribution\\nof neutral, deleterious, and beneficial mutants for a given dis-\\ntance. In simulations, these fitness values were assigned dynami-\\ncally to newly encountered phenotypes. It is important to note,\\nhowever, that this landscape chosen is still an approximation that\\nignores many potentially important effects, such as the heteroge-\\nneity of the mutational neighborhoods within the phenotype\\nspace.\\n\\nWe tested this quasispecies model with the ultradeep sequen-\\ncing data (9, 22) of the SIVepitope Tat28–35SL8 (38). Fig. 1 shows\\nthe time dependence of the viral load and WT frequency from\\nsimulations of the single-epitope version of Eq. 3 compared with\\nthe experimental data (22). The initial rapid growth of the viral\\nload, its subsequent decrease as CTLs are activated, and the more\\ngradual increase as mutants appear are all captured quantita-\\ntively. The WT frequency decrease agrees with experimental\\ntrends (Fig. 1B) with signatures of two distinct time scales (22).\\nThe mutation rate we used (μ ¼ 2 × 10−7 bp−1) was chosen to\\nobtain the best overall agreement for WT frequency with the sin-\\ngle-epitope version of the model. For multiepitope applications,\\nlarger mutation rate values close to the experimental estimate\\nfor HIV-1 (μ ¼ 3.4 × 10−5 bp−1) (39) gave realistic dynamics\\n(Fig. 2).\\n\\nFig. 1B also shows the frequency of the most dominant escape\\nmutant (EM) at each time point. As mutations occur, a new strain\\nproliferates temporarily before being curbed down, and the total\\nnumber of phenotypes continues to increase. The increase in via-\\nbility of populations with multiple but lower fitness peaks has\\nbeen described first by Schuster and Swetina (40) and has later\\nbeen known as the “survival of the flattest” effect (41). Further\\ninsights into the role this expansion in sequence space plays in the\\ngrowth of viral loads can be gained from the deterministic con-\\ntinuum approximation, Eq. 4, without mutation: The immune re-\\nsponse to WT leads to damped oscillations of viral load and CTL\\n\\nlevel (Fig. S4), reaching a steady state n� and c�. This process is\\nrepeated for each new mutant, leading to continued increases\\nin n� and c� roughly proportional to the number of phenotypes\\n(18). However, the timing, distribution, and the probability of\\nthe appearance of mutants are highly nontrivial functions of\\nthe characteristics of the system, including genome length, gen-\\notype–phenotype map, and fitness landscape. Our quantitative\\nquasispecies-based model, Eq. 3, provides a realistic description\\nof this complex diversification process via the single parameter μ.\\nWe note that, for a single epitope, this interpretation ignores the\\neffects of competition among viral strains because each CTL\\nis specific to only one phenotype. In reality, in addition to com-\\npeting directly for host cells, different viral strains share their vul-\\nnerability to CTLs specific to common epitopes within their\\ngenomes. By considering multiple epitopes within a strain, our\\nmodel takes into account this interdependence of viral strains\\nand their indirect competition arising from shared epitope phe-\\nnotypes (see below).\\n\\nAs a quantitative measure of the relative degree of WT\\npersistence during immune escape, we also examined the time\\n(half-life) required for WT frequency to reach one-half (Fig. 1B)\\n(22) with varying stimulation rate b and clearance rate p (Fig. S7).\\nThe SIV epitopes studied by Bimber et al. (9) were estimated to\\nhave a WT half-life of about 20 d (22). We found that, within our\\nmodel, the WT half-life increases with increasing p and b in this\\nrange: An increase in the magnitude of selection pressure, rather\\nthan accelerating immune escape, suppresses viral population\\ngrowth more effectively and reduces the chances of escape muta-\\ntion (Fig. 2). The immune escape thus becomes more pronounced\\nwhen viral loads in the chronic phase are larger with more fre-\\nquent mutations.\\n\\nDisease Progression Under Immune Response.We examined general\\ntrends of viral infection-immune response dynamics within our\\nquasispecies model on multiple-epitope levels (l ¼ 3) with varia-\\ntions of key model parameters. The evolutionary dynamics, in\\nparticular, is critically affected by p, the clearance rate represent-\\ning the effectiveness of immune response, and the mutation\\nrate μ.

The level of CTLs also rises consistently during\\nthe chronic phase (Fig. 2B). This disease progression is accom-\\npanied by an increase in the diversity of quasispecies, or the\\n“spreading of clouds” (Fig. 2C). The time scale for the duration\\nof the chronic phase, in particular, varied sensitively with p and μ\\n(from a few months to years) (Fig. 2A). We found that the total\\nnumber of phenotypes per epitope (Fig. 2C) generally goes down\\nas the number of epitopes increases: A new escape mutant has\\nmuch lower probability for survival with multiple epitopes be-\\ncause it shares WT phenotypes on other parts of its genome with\\nexisting strains, and therefore is susceptible to CTLs that are al-\\nready present.\\n\\nThe disease progression pattern in the runaway regime corre-\\nsponds to situations where the immune system is overwhelmed by\\nviral growth, either shortly after infection (there is no discernible\\nchronic phase for sufficiently small p) or after a long chronic\\nphase and accumulation of escape mutants. The latter case clo-\\nsely matches the characteristic HIV-1 disease pathogenesis (7),\\nrevealing the major role played by the uncontrolled diversifica-\\ntion of the quasispecies that overwhelms the CTL response. This\\nfeature was first suggested by Nowak and May (19), who coined\\nthe term “diversity threshold” based on a model assuming ran-\\ndom appearances of mutants. Our results show that the basic qua-\\nsispecies dynamics under selection pressure provide a realistic\\ndescription of this phenomenon.\\n\\nIf p is sufficiently large and μ sufficiently small, one enters a\\ndifferent regime (“extinction,” Fig. 3), where the acute and\\nchronic phases lead to viral loads that decrease either rapidly\\nor asymptotically with time. As populations shrink in size, their\\ndynamics become increasingly stochastic, and extinction (a com-\\nplete clearance of infection) occurs when the viral load reaches\\nzero. This behavior is inherently stochastic and cannot be cap-\\ntured by the deterministic approximation in Eq. 4. The time re-\\nquired for clearing the infection (“extinction time”) typically has\\na broad distribution, increasing with decreasing p while becoming\\ninfinite above a threshold μ (Fig. 4A). The rapid clearance of in-\\nfection within approximately 10 d corresponds to the normal state\\nof affairs in a healthy immune system against viruses such as in-\\nfluenza. As shown in Fig. 3A (p ¼ 0.01 d−1), however, the extinc-\\ntion time can also reach time scales approaching a patient’s\\n\\nlifetime. This feature may be relevant in understanding the basis\\nfor some chronic viral infections with long and stable setpoints\\n(e.g., hepatitis C), although the high variability of extinction times\\nwe observed (Fig. 4A) likely may not correspond to actual pos-\\nsible clearances of such chronic infections.\\n\\nThe threshold separating the runaway (Fig. 2) and extinction\\n(Fig. 3) regimes can be identified by the maximum mutation\\nrate for which the extinction time remains finite (Fig. 4A). This\\nerror threshold for the immune control of infection is analo-\\ngous to Eigen’s threshold for genomic stability: The latter is\\nthe error rate above which replicators cannot maintain a stable\\nmaster sequence. The former is a maximum mutation rate the\\ngiven immune system can suppress. Fig. 4B shows this threshold\\nas a function of p and μ. A given virus would have roughly the\\nsame mutation rate, while p would vary with individual patients.\\nThe sensitivity of disease progression with p is consistent with\\nthe observation that even when the fatality rate of a certain\\ninfection is known, the course of infection in a patient is often\\nunpredictable.\\n\\nThe case for HIV-1 is unique in the sense that without treat-\\nment, most patients eventually progress to the disease stage. One\\nof the special characteristics of HIV-1 is that it targets CD4þ\\n(helper) Tcells, which play critical roles in eliciting and mediating\\nCTL responses. Within the context of our model, the destruction\\nof CD4þ Tcells would lead to a gradual decrease in both the sti-\\nmulation rate b and the clearance rate p. One therefore expects a\\ncontinual deterioration of any initial effective control of infec-\\ntion, represented by p values that decrease over the course of dis-\\nease progression. In Fig. 4B, therefore, even though patients with\\nstronger immune systems may have p values initially in the extinc-\\ntion regime, the continued depletion of CD4þ cells would lower p\\nand cause them to cross the threshold.\\n\\nConclusions\\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that the classic quasispecies the-\\nory can form the basis of a quantitative model of virus evolution\\nunder immune selection. One of the apparent challenges in de-\\nveloping such a model is that viral genomes, while relatively small\\n(approximately 104 bp), still constitute a huge sequence space.\\nHere, we showed that a set of epitopes (La ∼ 10 amino acids)\\ncan be considered as minimal units of genomic segments on which\\nselection acts. In standard quasispecies theory, competition be-\\ntween different strains arises indirectly from the constraint of\\nfixed total population size. In our model, the degradation and\\nremoval of virions occur via immune response, which can be re-\\ngarded as a concrete specification of the selection forces. In this\\ncase, indirect competition occurs because most viral strains share\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\n10\\n4\\n\\nV\\nira\\n\\nl l\\noa\\n\\nd\\n\\n10\\n0\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\n10\\n4\\n\\nTime (d)\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nN\\no.\\n\\n o\\nf p\\n\\nhe\\nno\\n\\nty\\npe\\n\\ns\\n\\np = 0.01 d\\n-1\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\nC\\nT\\n\\nL\\n\\nAcute\\nChronic\\n\\nExtinction\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nC\\n\\n} p = 0.02 d\\n-1\\n\\nFig. 3.

We also note,\\nhowever, that more realistic representations of T-cell stimulation\\nand clearance will have to take their dependence on phenotypes\\ninto account (p and b should depend on amino acid sequences),\\nbecause mutations affect HLA-epitope-CTL binding affinities.\\nOur model also ignores complex epistatic effects coupling muta-\\ntions on the same and different epitopes (43). The approach pre-\\nsented here likely can provide a foundation for a more compre-\\nhensive modeling framework to tackle such global genome-wide\\neffects. In addition, although we interpreted Eqs. 3B–3D strictly\\nas the CTL-mediated immune response, we expect similar ap-\\nproaches to be applicable for antibody-based responses.\\n\\nMethods\\nStochastic Evolutionary Dynamics. Simulations are carried out by applying the\\nGillespie algorithm (26) to Eq. 3. At a given time, a dynamic list of genotypes\\nand phenotypes (N and M in total, respectively), starting with a single WT at\\nthe initial condition, is kept and updated, instead of enumerating all possible\\nsequences. A genotype consists of the nucleotide sequence of a set of epi-\\ntopes (l in total), each with the same length L, such that the total length be-\\ncomes l × L. We define the following quantities\\n\\naðrÞi ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nrjnj; a\\n\\nðsÞ\\ni ¼ ∑\\n\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nðrj þ bÞnj;\\n\\naðcÞi ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nðrj þ bþ pcjÞnj; aðdÞα ¼ aðcÞN þ g∑\\n\\nα\\n\\nβ¼1\\ncðβÞ;\\n\\neach corresponding to the replication, stimulation, clearance, and decay re-\\nactions (Eq. 3), respectively, where cj ¼ ΣkcðαjkÞ is the total number of CTLs\\ncorresponding to any of the epitope phenotypes belonging to the genotype\\nj. A random number 0 < r < 1 is drawn to determine the time interval Δt ¼\\nð1∕aÞ lnð1∕rÞ before the next reaction event, where a ¼ a ðdÞM . A second ran-\\ndom number r is drawn, and if aðxÞi−1 < ar < a\\n\\nðxÞ\\ni for x ¼ r, s, c, the replication,\\n\\nstimulation, or clearance reaction is chosen for the genotype i, respectively. If\\na ðdÞα−1 < ar < a\\n\\nðdÞ\\nα instead, the decay reaction is carried out for the CTL with phe-\\n\\nnotype α. In this algorithm, therefore, a given CTL contributes equally to the\\nclearance probabilities of all viral strains containing its phenotype. This pre-\\nscription generates unbiased trajectories of two classes of objects, the viruses\\nwith genotype i and phenotype αik and CTLs with phenotype α. For replica-\\ntion reactions, the chosen genotype i is mutated with probability μ per bp.\\nFurther details on implementing the genotype-phenotype lists can be found\\nin SI Text.\\n\\nSimulation Conditions. The standard genetic code was used to translate\\nmutant genotypes into phenotypes. The reduced fitness sα ¼ rατ of a pheno-\\ntype αwas taken as follows: sα ¼ 1 for theWT, and for all other phenotypes sα\\nis a random variable with the following Gaussian distribution: PðsαÞ ¼\\nexpf−½sα − fðdαÞ�2�∕2σ2g∕ð2πÞ1∕2σ, where the position of the maximum\\nfðdαÞ ¼ expð−dα∕ξÞ is an exponentially decreasing function of the distance\\ndα ≥ 1 (summed over all epitopes; in units of amino acids) of the phenotype\\nα to the WT. The parameters ξ and σ are the measures of the fitness costs of\\nmutations and of randomness in fitness distributions, respectively. During si-\\nmulations, a newly encountered phenotype is dynamically assigned a fitness\\nvalue based on this distributionwith negative rα values replaced by zero. Phe-\\nnotypes containing stop codons were assigned zero fitness. In Fig. 1, the SIV\\nepitope Tat28–35SL8 with the WT sequence of 5′-TCC ACT CCA GAA TCG GCC\\nAAC CTG-3′ (STPESANL) (38) was used (La ¼ 8 and l ¼ 1). In Figs. 2–4, random\\nsequences were used for the WT and simulations were performed with La ¼\\n10 and l ¼ 3. Typically, quantities were averaged over 102 ∼ 103 trajectories\\nunless otherwise specified.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

       " 'ved for review October 18, 2011)\\n\\nViral infections involve a complex interplay of the immune\\nresponse and escape mutation of the virus quasispecies inside a\\nsingle host. Although fundamental aspects of such a balance of\\nmutation and selection pressure have been established by the qua-\\nsispecies theory decades ago, its implications have largely re-\\nmained qualitative. Here, we present a quantitative approach to\\nmodel the virus evolution under cytotoxic T-lymphocyte immune\\nresponse. The virus quasispecies dynamics are explicitly repre-\\nsented by mutations in the combined sequence space of a set of\\nepitopes within the viral genome. We stochastically simulated the\\ngrowth of a viral population originating from a single wild-type\\nfounder virus and its recognition and clearance by the immune re-\\nsponse, as well as the expansion of its genetic diversity. Applied to\\nthe immune escape of a simian immunodeficiency virus epitope,\\nmodel predictions were quantitatively comparable to the experi-\\nmental data. Within the model parameter space, we found two\\nqualitatively different regimes of infectious disease pathogenesis,\\neach representing alternative fates of the immune response: It can\\nclear the infection in finite time or eventually be overwhelmed by\\nviral growth and escape mutation. The latter regime exhibits the\\ncharacteristic disease progression pattern of human immunodefi-\\nciency virus, while the former is bounded by maximum mutation\\nrates that can be suppressed by the immune response. Our results\\ndemonstrate that, by explicitly representing epitope mutations\\nand thus providing a genotype–phenotype map, the quasispecies\\ntheory can form the basis of a detailed sequence-specific model of\\nreal-world viral pathogens evolving under immune selection.\\n\\npopulation dynamics ∣ next-generation sequencing ∣ stochastic simulation ∣\\nHIV\\n\\nViruses with RNA genomes, such as human immunodeficiencyvirus type 1 (HIV-1), have high rates of mutation and evolve\\nrapidly in response to host immune selection pressure. One of the\\nconsequences of such rapid mutations is the error catastrophe\\n(1), where a virus population is driven to extinction when its mu-\\ntation rate exceeds a threshold. The existence of such a threshold\\nis a central prediction of the quasispecies theory pioneered by\\nEigen (1) and Swetina and Schuster (2). The recent experimental\\ndemonstration of lethal mutagenesis (3–5), in which an error cat-\\nastrophe transition is caused by mutagens, demonstrates that key\\nfeatures of the balance of mutation and selection in viruses are\\nelegantly captured by the quasispecies theory.\\n\\nAlthough insights provided by the quasispecies theory have\\ngreatly expanded our understanding of virus behavior, applica-\\ntions so far have been limited to a conceptual level, partially due\\nto the lack of experimental information on the evolutionary dy-\\nnamics in sequence space. Next-generation sequencing techni-\\nques (6) have the potential to change this situation.

       " 'r capacity for rapid\\nescape mutation underlies many of the difficulties in combating\\npathogens, including HIV-1. In a typical disease pathogenesis of\\nHIV-1, the acute viremia after an initial infection is curbed by\\n\\nCD8þ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses as well as subse-\\nquent antibody actions, leading to an asymptomatic chronic infec-\\ntion stage that can last up to 10 y (7). However, this apparent\\ncontrol of viremia is never complete, and without antiviral ther-\\napy, the chronic infection eventually leads to the onset of disease.\\nThis chronic infection stage involves continuous escape mutation-\\nCTL response cycles, whose detailed characteristics are b',\n",

CTLs recognize specific\\nviral epitopes (approximately 10 amino acids long) presented on\\nthe surface of infected cells by class I human leukocyte antigen\\n(HLA). The epitope recognition depends sensitively on HLA al-\\nleles, leading to differential patterns of immune response among\\npatients (13–15), while characteristics of immune response during\\nearly infection often shape and influence the overall disease pro-\\ngression (16, 17). Quantitative sequence-based models of virus-\\nCTL dynamics will greatly facilitate the interpretation of experi-\\nmental data.\\n\\nIn a series of pioneering works (18–20), Nowak and coworkers\\nintroduced population dynamics concepts that capture a diverse\\nrange of immune response and escape mutation. Similar ap-\\nproaches focused more on escape dynamics have also been pro-\\nposed (21, 22). These models, however, do not describe mutations\\nin sequence space explicitly. Other mathematical models of\\nsequence evolution focus on sequence divergence during the very\\nearly stages of infection, while ignoring or only implicitly including\\nthe effect of selection pressure (23, 24). In this paper, we describe\\na quantitative quasispecies-based model of virus dynamics under\\nT cell-based immune pressure, explicitly mapping genotype–phe-\\nnotype relationships. Our approach combines the description of\\nvirus evolutionary dynamics provided by the quasispecies theory\\nand the population dynamics models of Nowak and coworkers.\\nWe show that the model not only captures the salient features\\nobserved in sequencing data of simian immunodeficiency virus\\n(SIV) (9) but also reveals general qualitative features of viral\\ninfection disease pathogenesis: The immune system can clear\\nthe infection within time scales ranging from days to those much\\nlonger than patient lifetimes, or be overwhelmed by immune es-\\ncape.

Nowak and Schuster (27)\\nperformed Gillespie algorithm simulations of the standard qua-\\nsispecies model under the single-peak fitness landscape (ri ¼ 1∕τ\\nfor the wild-type (WT) sequence and ri ¼ 1∕Aτ for all other mu-\\ntants, whereA > 1 is the relative fitness of theWTand τ is a char-\\nacteristic time scale). In this case, distributions of individuals\\namong only two groups (WT and mutants) need to be tracked.\\n\\nIn our numerical simulations, the initial genotype (referred to\\nhere as the WT) replicates with mutation rate μ, and the gener-\\nated mutants are compared with the existing list of sequences,\\nwhich is updated dynamically when new sequences arise. We ver-\\nified that this numerical scheme sampled the relevant sequence\\nspace sufficiently (SI Text, Figs. S1–S3). The initial condition we\\nused (single WT) and the discreteness of ni imply that ni should\\nbe interpreted as the total number of virions within a finite sys-\\ntem. The HIV-1 viral load during the acute infection phase can\\nreach up to 104 ∼ 106 RNA copies/mL (7). Accounting for the\\nvolume of blood in the body of an average adult (approximately\\n5 L), the total population size Nv ¼ Σi ni would be up to about\\n109. We found simulations to slow down significantly as Nv be-\\ncame larger than about 106. For computational efficiency, we\\ntherefore regarded the system as a small representative volume\\n(1 mL) of blood, and the viral loads and CTL levels reported refer\\nto RNA copy numbers and cell counts within this volume.\\n\\nCTL Response. Within an infected host, the action of the cellular\\nimmune response provides the major force countering the acute\\nviremia. In this work, we combine the population dynamics ap-\\nproach of virus-immune system dynamics by Nowak and cowor-\\nkers (18, 19) with the classic quasispecies theory. Accordingly,\\nEq. 2 is modified as follows:\\n\\nRi →\\nQjiri\\n\\nRi þRj; ðreplication with mutationÞ [3A]\\n\\nRi→\\nb\\nRi þ∑\\n\\nl\\n\\nk¼1\\nCðαikÞ; ðstimulationÞ [3B]\\n\\nRi þ CðαikÞ→\\np\\nCðαikÞ; ðclearanceÞ [3C]\\n\\nCðαÞ→\\ng\\n0; ðdecayÞ [3D]\\n\\nwhere the genotype i is now a member of the combined sequence\\nspace of l epitopes. The amino acid sequence (“phenotype”) of\\nepitope k in genotype i is denoted as αik, and CðαÞ represents a\\n\\nCTL specific to phenotype α. Eq. 3B represents a reaction in\\nwhich, with a rate b, virions of sequence i stimulate the produc-\\ntion of a set of CTLs CðαikÞ corresponding to the phenotypes of\\nits epitopes. Eq. 3C denotes the reaction where cells infected with\\nviruses with genotype i are cleared by CTLs with phenotypes that\\nmatch one of its epitopes with a rate p, and Eq. 3D represents the\\nnatural decay of T cells with a rate g. Under the alternative de-\\nterministic continuum approximation, one may write:\\n\\n_nj ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nQjirini − p∑\\nl\\n\\nk¼1\\ncðαjkÞnj; [4A]\\n\\n_cðαÞ ¼ bnα − gcðαÞ; [4B]\\n\\nwhere cðαÞ is the number of Tcells CðαÞ and nα is the total num-\\nber of virions containing epitopes with phenotype α.\\n\\nThe qualitative features of the infection-clearance dynamics\\ncan be illustrated by setting the mutation rate μ to zero. Numer-\\nical integrations of Eq. 4 yield the continuum approximation re-\\nsult (Fig. S4 for μ ¼ 0 and l ¼ 1), which showed reasonable\\nagreement with the stochastic simulation results. For nonvanish-\\ning mutation rates, numerical integration rapidly becomes prohi-\\nbitive with increasing L because of the high dimensionality of the\\nsequence space. The inverse of b is a measure of the time delay of\\nthe growth of T cells compared to that of viruses. Here, we\\nadopted b values of approximately 0.01 d−1. The efficiency of\\nCTLs in recognizing cells presenting the epitope and killing them\\nis represented by parameter p, the clearance rate. We found\\np values of 10−4 ∼ 10−3 d−1 to give good fits to experiments\\n(see below).\\n\\nImmune Escape Dynamics. To make comparisons with experiments,\\nit is necessary to consider that fitness is determined by amino acid\\nsequences, and many mutations are synonymous. Therefore, the\\nfull immune escape dynamics represented by Eq. 3 distinguishes\\nthe amino acid sequence αik corresponding to the nucleotide\\nsequence of epitope k in genotype i. We refer to the set of nu-\\ncleotide and amino acid sequences as “genotypes” and “pheno-\\ntypes,” respectively. The fitness ri is a function of phenotypes\\nonly. During simulations, each genotype is translated into a phe-\\nnotype, and a new mutant is checked against the existing pheno-\\ntype/genotype list, which is updated and expanded. The nature of\\nthis genotype–phenotype map plays important roles in evolution-\\nary dynamics, leading to key signatures of selective pressure, such\\nas the ratio of synonymous to nonsynonymous mutations (28).\\nQuantitative insights to the effects of this mapping on molecular\\nevolution have been provided by Manrubia and coworkers (29),\\nwho studied short RNA sequences for which fitness can be esti-\\nmated by secondary structure predictions. In our case, a simpli-\\nfied overview of the genotype–phenotype map can be gleaned\\nfrom a network representation of the genetic code (Fig. S5): If\\nall mutations were neutral and amino acids within an epitope in-\\ndependent, this map would be sufficient to determine the statis-\\ntics of evolutionary drifts. The accessibility of certain mutations\\nfrom a phenotype, in particular, has been shown to affect the\\nevolvability of viruses (30).\\n\\nAnother major ingredient for a realistic model of immune es-\\ncape is the fitness landscape beyond the level of the single-peak\\nmodel. Much progress has been made recently in understanding\\nthe nature of fitness landscapes (31–34). Explicit fitness measure-\\nments of viral clones (35, 36) and biochemical assays of prot',\n",

The initial rapid growth of the viral\\nload, its subsequent decrease as CTLs are activated, and the more\\ngradual increase as mutants appear are all captured quantita-\\ntively. The WT frequency decrease agrees with experimental\\ntrends (Fig. 1B) with signatures of two distinct time scales (22).\\nThe mutation rate we used (μ ¼ 2 × 10−7 bp−1) was chosen to\\nobtain the best overall agreement for WT frequency with the sin-\\ngle-epitope version of the model.

The increase in via-\\nbility of populations with multiple but lower fitness peaks has\\nbeen described first by Schuster and Swetina (40) and has later\\nbeen known as the “survival of the flattest” effect (41). Further\\ninsights into the role this expansion in sequence space plays in the\\ngrowth of viral loads can be gained from the deterministic con-\\ntinuum approximation, Eq. 4, without mutation: The immune re-\\nsponse to WT leads to damped oscillations of viral load and CTL\\n\\nlevel (Fig. S4), reaching a steady state n� and c�. This process is\\nrepeated for each new mutant, leading to continued increases\\nin n� and c� roughly proportional to the number of phenotypes\\n(18). However, the timing, distribution, and the probability of\\nthe appearance of mutants are highly nontrivial functions of\\nthe characteristics of the system, including genome length, gen-\\notype–phenotype map, and fitness landscape. Our quantitative\\nquasispecies-based model, Eq. 3, provides a realistic description\\nof this complex diversification process via the single parameter μ.\\nWe note that, for a single epitope, this interpretation ignores the\\neffects of competition among viral strains because each CTL\\nis specific to only one phenotype.

(9) were estimated to\\nhave a WT half-life of about 20 d (22). We found that, within our\\nmodel, the WT half-life increases with increasing p and b in this\\nrange: An increase in the magnitude of selection pressure, rather\\nthan accelerating immune escape, suppresses viral population\\ngrowth more effectively and reduces the chances of escape muta-\\ntion (Fig. 2).

The level of CTLs also rises consistently during\\nthe chronic phase (Fig. 2B). This disease progression is accom-\\npanied by an increase in the diversity of quasispecies, or the\\n“spreading of clouds” (Fig. 2C). The time scale for the duration\\nof the chronic phase, in particular, varied sensitively with p and μ\\n(from a few months to years) (Fig. 2A). We found that the total\\nnumber of phenotypes per epitope (Fig. 2C) generally goes down\\nas the number of epitopes increases: A new escape mutant has\\nmuch lower probability for survival with multiple epitopes be-\\ncause it shares WT phenotypes on other parts of its genome with\\nexisting strains, and therefore is susceptible to CTLs that are al-\\nready present.\\n\\nThe disease progression pattern in the runaway regime corre-\\nsponds to situations where the immune system is overwhelmed by\\nviral growth, ',\n",

The latter case clo-\\nsely matches the characteristic HIV-1 disease pathogenesis (7),\\nrevealing the major role played by the uncontrolled diversifica-\\ntion of the quasispecies that overwhelms the CTL response. This\\nfeature was first suggested by Nowak and May (19), who coined\\nthe term “diversity threshold” based on a model assuming ran-\\ndom appearances of mutants. Our results show that the basic qua-\\nsispecies dynamics under selection pressure provide a realistic\\ndescription of this phenomenon.\\n\\nIf p is sufficiently large and μ sufficiently small, one enters a\\ndifferent regime (“extinction,” Fig. 3), where the acute and\\nchronic phases lead to viral loads that decrease ',\n",

       " 'r\\ndynamics become increasingly stochastic, and extinction (a com-\\nplete clearance of infection) occurs when the viral load reaches\\nzero. This behavior is inherently stochastic and cannot be cap-\\ntured by the deterministic approximation in Eq. 4. The time re-\\nquired for clearing the infection (“extinction time”) typically has\\na broad distribution, increasing with decreasing p while becoming\\ninfinite above a threshold μ (Fig. 4A). The rapid clearance of in-\\nfection within approximately 10 d corresponds to the normal state\\nof affairs in a healthy immune system against viruses such as in-\\nfluenza. As shown in Fig. 3A (p ¼ 0.01 d−1), however, the extinc-\\ntion time can also reach time scales approaching a patient’s\\n\\nlifetime. This feature may be relevant in understanding the basis\\nfor some chronic viral infections with long and stable setpoints\\n(e.g., hepatitis C), although the high variability of extinction times\\nwe observed (Fig. 4A) likely may not correspond to actual pos-\\nsible clearances of such chronic infections.\\n\\nThe threshold separating the runaway (Fig. 2) and extinction\\n(Fig. 3) regimes can be identified by the maximum mutation\\nrate for which the extinction time remains finite (Fig. 4A). This\\nerror threshold for the immune control of infection is analo-\\ngous to Eigen’s threshold for genomic stability: The latter is\\nthe error rate above which replicators cannot maintain a stable\\nmaster sequence. The former is a maximum mutation rate the\\ngiven immune system can suppress. Fig. 4B shows this threshold\\nas a function of p and μ. A given virus would have roughly the\\nsame mutation rate, while p would vary with individual patients.\\nThe sensitivity of disease progression with p is consistent with\\nthe observation that even when the fatality rate of a certain\\ninfection is known, the course of infection in a patient is often\\nunpredictable.\\n\\nThe case for HIV-1 is unique in the sense that without treat-\\nment, most patients eventually progress to the disease stage. One\\nof the special characteristics of HIV-1 is that it targets CD4þ\\n(helper) Tcells, which play critical roles in eliciting and mediating\\nCTL responses. Within the context of our model, the destruction\\nof CD4þ Tcells would lead to a gradual decrease in both the sti-\\nmulation rate b and the clearance rate p. One therefore expects a\\ncontinual deterioration of any initial effective control of infec-\\ntion, represented by p values that decrease over the course of dis-\\nease progression. In Fig. 4B, therefore, even though patients with\\nstronger immune systems may have p values initially in the extinc-\\ntion regime, the continued depletion of CD4þ cells would lower p\\nand cause them to cross the threshold.\\n\\nConclusions\\nIn this paper, we demonstrated that the classic quasispecies the-\\nory can form the basis of a quantitative model of virus evolution\\nunder immune selection. One of the apparent challenges in de-\\nveloping such a model is that viral genomes, while relatively small\\n(approximately 104 bp), still constitute a huge sequence space.\\nHere, we showed that a set of epitopes (La ∼ 10 amino acids)\\ncan be considered as minimal units of genomic segments on which\\nselection acts. In standard quasispecies theory, competition be-\\ntween different strains arises indirectly from the constraint of\\nfixed total population size. In our model, the degradation and\\nremoval of virions occur via immune response, which can be re-\\ngarded as a concrete specification of the selection forces. In this\\ncase, indirect competition occurs because most viral strains share\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\n10\\n4\\n\\nV\\nira\\n\\nl l\\noa\\n\\nd\\n\\n10\\n0\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\n10\\n4\\n\\nTime (d)\\n\\n1\\n\\n2\\n\\n3\\n\\n4\\n\\nN\\no.\\n\\n o\\nf p\\n\\nhe\\nno\\n\\nty\\npe\\n\\ns\\n\\np = 0.01 d\\n-1\\n\\n10\\n1\\n\\n10\\n2\\n\\n10\\n3\\n\\nC\\nT\\n\\nL\\n\\nAcute\\nChronic\\n\\nExtinction\\n\\nA\\n\\nB\\n\\nC\\n\\n} p = 0.02 d\\n-1\\n\\nFig. 3.

The approach pre-\\nsented here likely can provide a foundation for a more compre-\\nhensive modeling framework to tackle such global genome-wide\\neffects. In addition, although we interpreted Eqs. 3B–3D strictly\\nas the CTL-mediated immune response, we expect similar ap-\\nproaches to be applicable for antibody-based responses.\\n\\nMethods\\nStochastic Evolutionary Dynamics. Simulations are carried out by applying the\\nGillespie algorithm (26) to Eq. 3. At a given time, a dynamic list of genotypes\\nand phenotypes (N and M in total, respectively), starting with a single WT at\\nthe initial condition, is kept and updated, instead of enumerating all possible\\nsequences. A genotype consists of the nucleotide sequence of a set of epi-\\ntopes (l in total), each with the same length L, such that the total length be-\\ncomes l × L. We define the following quantities\\n\\naðrÞi ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nrjnj; a\\n\\nðsÞ\\ni ¼ ∑\\n\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nðrj þ bÞnj;\\n\\naðcÞi ¼ ∑\\ni\\n\\nj¼1\\nðrj þ bþ pcjÞnj; aðdÞα ¼ aðcÞN þ g∑\\n\\nα\\n\\nβ¼1\\ncðβÞ;\\n\\neach corresponding to the replication, stimulation, clearance, and decay re-\\nactions (Eq. 3), respectively, where cj ¼ ΣkcðαjkÞ is the total number of CTLs\\ncorresponding to any of the epitope phenotypes belonging to the genotype\\nj. A random number 0 < r < 1 is drawn to determine the time interval Δt ¼\\nð1∕aÞ lnð1∕rÞ before the next reaction event, where a ¼ a ðdÞM . A second ran-\\ndom number r is drawn, and if aðxÞi−1 < ar < a\\n\\nðxÞ\\ni for x ¼ r, s, c, the replication,\\n\\nstimulation, or clearance reaction is chosen for the genotype i, respectively. If\\na ðdÞα−1 < ar < a\\n\\nðdÞ\\nα instead, the decay reaction is carried out for the CTL with phe-\\n\\nnotype α. In this algorithm, therefore, a given CTL contributes equally to the\\nclearance probabilities of all viral strains containing its phenotype. This pre-\\nscription generates unbiased trajectories of two classes of objects, the viruses\\nwith genotype i and phenotype αik and CTLs with phenotype α. For replica-\\ntion reactions, the chosen genotype i is mutated with probability μ per bp.\\nFurther details on implementing the genotype-phenotype lists can be found\\nin SI Text.\\n\\nSimulation Conditions. The standard genetic code was used to translate\\nmutant genotypes into phenotypes. The reduced fitness sα ¼ rατ of a pheno-\\ntype αwas taken as follows: sα ¼ 1 for theWT, and for all other phenotypes sα\\nis a random variable with the following Gaussian distribution: PðsαÞ ¼\\nexpf−½sα − fðdαÞ�2�∕2σ2g∕ð2πÞ1∕2σ, where the position of the maximum\\nfðdαÞ ¼ expð−dα∕ξÞ is an exponentially decreasing function of the distance\\ndα ≥ 1 (summed over all epitopes; in units of amino acids) of the phenotype\\nα to the WT. The parameters ξ and σ are the measures of the fitness costs of\\nmutations and of randomness in fitness distributions, respectively. During si-\\nmulations, a newly encountered phenotype is dynamically assigned a fitness\\nvalue based on this distributionwith negative rα values replaced by zero. Phe-\\nnotypes containing stop codons were assigned zero fitness. In Fig. 1, the SIV\\nepitope Tat28–35SL8 with the WT sequence of 5′-TCC ACT CCA GAA TCG GCC\\nAAC CTG-3′ (STPESANL) (38) was used (La ¼ 8 and l ¼ 1). In Figs. 2–4, random\\nsequences were used for the WT and simulations were performed with La ¼\\n10 and l ¼ 3. Typically, quantities were averaged over 102 ∼ 103 trajectories\\nunless otherwise specified.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
